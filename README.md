Blogr landing page - Challenge from FrontendMentor

In this challenge I used preprocessor Scss, and practiced his implemantation in styling. Also used library GSAP for animations. This project was developed First Mobile (width: 375px), and has responsive design with a change of layout over width: 1200px.
